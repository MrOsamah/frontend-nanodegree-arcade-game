# The Princess and the Ghosts (Clone of Frogger)

This is the final project of the Intermediate JavaScript chapter of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

### How to Play

  - First Click [here](https://mrosamah.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/).
  - You will use keyboard's arrows to controll the character.
  - The goal is to collect **6** keys and then go through the gate.
  - The enemies will steal one key from you if you collide with them, also that will cost you one of your lives.
  - If you win please capture the screen and mention me with the result at [@MrOsamah](https://twitter.com/MrOsamah), and I will **pin** the best and fastest result.
